# Movie Stack üçø

Movie Stack is an Android application for movie tracking.

Currently, Movie Stack allows you to search for movies and serials, add them to your favorite and watched lists, notify you when your favorite movies and serials are released, and some other features.

We plan to add a number of features and improvements in the future. Here is [the roadmap of the project](https://yaroslavzghoba.notion.site/Movie-Stack-d21c7507dad645a3ba628f9c3bfbd148?pvs=74).
